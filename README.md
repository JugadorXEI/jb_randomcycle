# Randomcycle for JBEP3
SourceMod's randomcycle.sp redone to be used for JBEP3.

If something is broken/outdated, please let me know through a Github issue, or Discord (JugadorXEI#8724).

## Installation
This assumes you have SourceMod installed on your dedicated server. If not, go here: https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod

1. Get the latest release from the releases tab.
2. Drag'n'drop the addons folder to your addons folder which contains SourceMod in it.
3. On your `server.cfg` or `sourcemod/randomcycle.cfg` file, set `jb_sv_voting_enabled 0` in them. There's no need to vote as a new map and gamemode is set from the start.
3. Done!

If you have modified your `configs/maplists.cfg` file in some way, copy the map lists that start with `jbep3_` and paste them on your maplists.cfg file.

On `data/randomcycle_maplists.txt`, you can modify which gamemodes and maplists do you wish to feature in your server.

Enjoy!
